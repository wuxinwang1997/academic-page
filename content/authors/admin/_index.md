I am a Ph.D student of computer science at the Institute of Meteorological and Oceanic Numerical Simulation, National University of Defense Technology, advised by Prof. [Kaijun Ren](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kaijun-Ren). I am now woring on **AI for Earth**. For example, deep learning-based data assimilation, and weather forecasting big models.

I won the Lei Jun Scholarship of Wuhan Univerisity (School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Class of 2016, Top 1) in 2019.

My research interests include spatial-temporal forecasting, data assimilation, and deep learning. I have published 6 papers in top journals and conferences.
